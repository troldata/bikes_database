# Bikes

Efficient inventory management allows to optimize delivery processes and ensure the necessary inventory in each store. This helps improve customer service and prevent missed sales.
In this work, the database model of a bicycle shop chain in PostgreSQL is used. Analysis of sales and inventory data was conducted to sell out unpopular models and order popular bikes in stock. The process of loading (ETL-process) new data about the bikes arriving in the warehouse has been developed and automated.

Aims of this work:
+ Analysis of the company's income for 2018.
+ Optimization of warehouse use.
+ Development of loading new data from suppliers.

## Sources:
+ [Bike Store Relational Database | SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database/data)
+ File bikes_World_of_Bikes.csv is generated for the project. It is located in the project repository.
